# Devbhoomi_hackathon
This repo contains the code for speed detection, number plate detection, the honking system and the challan system
Hello everone, I am Sovit Patel currently an EI undergrad from NIT Rourkela. I participated in in Devbhoomi Cyber Hackathon 2.0 conducted by Uttarakhand Police at IIT Roorkee.
Out of 20 problem statements we chose the 16th PS which has the theme of Road safety.Here we secured 2nd position out of 40 finalist teams from all over the country.

Problem Statement: 16 (Road Safety)
PS (Prelims): Smart Pillars or sensors which may use Radio waves to measure the speed of upcoming vehicle and generate the centralised data for over speeding of vehicles. Can be used to for automatic Challan for violation. Must develop 04 such pillars for problem extension in the main round.

PS (Mains): Vehicle honk system where Sensors/Smart Pillars will interact with each other, and vehicles will be told about approaching vehicles from the other blind fold end or U-turn in hills. For instance- in a hilly area with a blind curve, both directions vehicle canâ€™t see or gauge whether another vehicle coming in their direction with speed, such sensors based upon speed instantly generate an alert/honking system to alert both drivers

Expectation: Road Safety is a big concern for police and such smart sensors/smart pillars will help to reduce accidents. Will be a useful installation where such sensors will alert in both directions regarding the movement of vehicles along with measurement of Speed.
